        <li>As kittens they have 26 deciduous, or “baby”, teeth. As adult cats they have 30 permanent teeth. Don’t forget to take care of those pearly whites with regular dental cleanings.</li>
        <li>House cats share 95.6% of their genetic makeup with tigers. You read that right, TIGERS. They also share some of the same behavior habits such as scent and urine marking, prey stalking and pouncing.</li>
        <li>Cats can jump 5 times their own height. Now that’s impressive!</li>
        <li>A housecat can run to the speed of about 30 mph over short distances. This means that a cat can outrun superstar runner Usain Bolt in a 200 meter dash!</li>
        <li>Ever wondered why your feline friend would often put their rear end by your face? This is actually a sign of trust and your cat signaling that they feel safe and secure around you.</li>
